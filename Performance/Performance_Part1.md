# Performance: Part 1

## Network Performance

### Minimize Files

Minimizing file sizes is crucial for increasing network performance because smaller files require less time to transfer over the network. Here are some techniques to reduce file sizes:

1. Minify CSS and JavaScript: Remove unnecessary whitespace, comments, and redundant code from your CSS and JavaScript files. There are various minification tools available that automate this process.

2. Compress Text-based Files: Enable compression on your server to reduce the size of text-based files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML. GZIP and Brotli are popular compression algorithms used by web servers.

3. Optimize Images: Images often contribute significantly to the size of a web page. Use image optimization techniques to reduce their file sizes without compromising quality. This includes compressing images, resizing them to appropriate dimensions, and choosing the optimal image format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, WebP) based on the content.

4. Serve Scaled Images: Avoid serving images larger than they appear on the web page. Resize and optimize images based on the required dimensions to reduce unnecessary data transfer.

5. Use Vector Graphics: Whenever possible, use vector graphics (e.g., SVG) instead of raster images. Vector graphics are resolution-independent and typically have smaller file sizes.

6. Lazy Load Images: Implement lazy loading techniques to load images only when they come into the user's viewport. This reduces the initial page load time by deferring the loading of off-screen or below-the-fold images.

7. Implement Icon Fonts or SVG Icons: Instead of using multiple small image files for icons, consider using icon fonts or scalable vector graphics (SVG) for icons. These techniques reduce the number of individual image requests.

8. Optimize Fonts: If you are using custom fonts, optimize them by subsetting, compressing, and converting them to more efficient formats like WOFF2. This helps reduce the font file size and enhances network performance.

9. Minimize Dependencies: Review and minimize the number of external libraries, frameworks, and plugins used in your web application. Each additional resource increases the overall file size.

10. Load Resources Asynchronously: Load resources such as JavaScript and CSS files asynchronously or defer their loading to avoid blocking the rendering of the page. This allows the browser to start rendering the page content while fetching resources in the background.

### Minimize Images

Minimizing images is an effective way to reduce file sizes and improve network performance. Here are some techniques to minimize images:

1. Image Compression: Utilize image compression techniques to reduce the file size while maintaining an acceptable level of visual quality. There are several tools available that automatically compress images, such as TinyPNG, JPEGmini, and ImageOptim. Alternatively, you can use image optimization libraries and plugins like imagemin for programmatic or batch compression.

2. Choose the Right Format: Select the appropriate image format based on the content and desired visual quality. The commonly used formats are:

   - JPEG: Ideal for complex photographs and images with many colors.
   - PNG: Suitable for images with transparency or simpler graphics with fewer colors.
   - WebP: A modern image format that offers both lossy and lossless compression, resulting in smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and PNG, while maintaining good quality.
   - SVG: Use scalable vector graphics for icons, logos, or simple graphics to ensure small file sizes and flexibility in scaling without loss of quality.

3. Resize Images: Scale down images to the required dimensions. Avoid serving larger images than necessary, as they increase file size and lead to slower downloads. Use image editing tools or libraries to resize images to the appropriate dimensions before uploading them to your website.

4. Optimize Image Quality: Adjust the image quality settings to find the optimal balance between file size and visual appearance. Depending on the image format, you can control the compression level or quality parameter to achieve the desired trade-off.

5. Use Image Sprites: Combine multiple small images into a single sprite sheet. By doing so, you reduce the number of HTTP requests required to load individual images, leading to faster page loading. CSS background positioning can then be used to display specific images from the sprite.

6. Lazy Load Images: Implement lazy loading for images, especially those that are not initially visible on the user's screen. Lazy loading defers the loading of off-screen or below-the-fold images, reducing the initial page load time.

7. Serve Responsive Images: Use responsive images that are appropriately sized based on the user's device capabilities. Serve different image sizes for different screen resolutions to avoid unnecessary data transfer and improve loading speed.

8. Consider CDN or Image Optimization Services: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can automatically optimize and deliver images at optimal sizes for different devices and network conditions. Additionally, specialized image optimization services, like Cloudinary or imgix, can dynamically process and serve optimized images on the fly.

Remember to strike a balance between minimizing file sizes and maintaining acceptable image quality. Regularly test the optimized images to ensure they still meet your requirements.


## Critical Render Path

The critical render path refers to the sequence of steps involved in rendering and displaying a web page's content on the user's screen. It encompasses the processes required to fetch, parse, and render the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up a web page. Optimizing the critical render path is crucial for improving the perceived performance and user experience of a website.

Here are the key steps involved in the critical render path:

1. HTML Parsing: The browser retrieves the HTML document from the server and starts parsing it. During this process, the browser builds the Document Object Model (DOM) by analyzing the structure of the HTML markup.

2. CSS Parsing and Rendering: As the browser encounters CSS resources (either embedded or linked), it begins parsing and constructing the CSS Object Model (CSSOM). The CSSOM represents the styles defined in the CSS files. The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to create the render tree, which represents the visual elements of the page.

3. Render Tree Construction: The render tree consists of the visual elements that need to be displayed, such as elements, text, and images. It excludes elements that are hidden or have CSS properties like "display: none." The render tree is used to determine the layout of the page.

4. Layout: The browser calculates the size and position of each element in the render tree during the layout (also known as reflow) process. It takes into account CSS properties like width, height, margin, and padding to determine the final positioning of elements on the page.

5. Painting: Once the layout is complete, the browser performs painting, which involves filling pixels on the screen with the appropriate colors and images based on the render tree and layout information.

6. Display: The painted content is finally displayed on the user's screen, making the web page visible.

Optimizing the critical render path involves various techniques to minimize the time spent on each step and deliver the content to the user as quickly as possible. Some strategies to improve the critical render path include:

- Minimizing the number of HTTP requests by reducing the number of external resources (CSS, JavaScript, images) and utilizing techniques like concatenation and minification.
- Using asynchronous loading and deferred execution of JavaScript to prevent blocking of rendering.
- Employing techniques like lazy loading and asynchronous image loading to prioritize the display of above-the-fold content and defer the loading of off-screen images.
- Utilizing CSS techniques like inlining critical styles and using media queries for responsive designs to reduce the time required for rendering.
- Implementing server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) to generate pre-rendered HTML on the server, reducing client-side processing and improving initial page load times.
- Applying caching strategies to cache static resources and reduce the need for repeated fetching and parsing.

By optimizing the critical render path, you can achieve faster page load times, quicker rendering of content, and an improved user experience.

## HTML Critical Render Path Optimization

HTML critical render path optimization techniques you can employ to improve the rendering speed and performance of your web pages:

1. Minimize HTML Size: Reduce the size of your HTML documents by removing unnecessary white spaces, comments, and line breaks. Compressing your HTML using techniques like GZIP compression can further reduce file size.

2. Inline Critical CSS: Inline the critical CSS directly into the `<head>` section of your HTML document. This ensures that the essential styles required to render the above-the-fold content are immediately available, eliminating the need for additional HTTP requests.

3. Load CSS Asynchronously: Use the `rel="preload"` attribute to load non-critical CSS files asynchronously. By doing so, the browser can fetch and parse the CSS files without blocking the rendering of the page, resulting in faster rendering times.

4. Optimize the Document Object Model (DOM): Keep your HTML structure clean and semantically meaningful. Minimize the use of unnecessary nested elements and redundant markup. A simplified DOM structure improves parsing and rendering efficiency.

5. Remove Render-Blocking JavaScript: Avoid loading JavaScript files that block the rendering process. Move non-critical JavaScript code to the bottom of the page or utilize techniques like asynchronous loading or deferred execution to ensure that JavaScript does not hinder rendering.

6. Minimize Redirects: Reduce the number of HTTP redirects in your HTML. Redirects introduce additional round trips and delay the rendering process. Use direct links whenever possible to avoid unnecessary redirects.

7. Implement Prefetching and Preloading: Use the `rel="prefetch"` or `rel="preload"` attributes to instruct the browser to fetch and cache resources required for subsequent page navigation. This allows the browser to proactively load critical assets, reducing latency during subsequent requests.

8. Optimize Web Fonts: If using custom web fonts, consider optimizing them to reduce their impact on rendering performance. Techniques include subsetting fonts to include only necessary characters and using font-display property to control font loading behavior.

9. Use HTML Caching: Implement server-side caching techniques to cache generated HTML content. By serving cached HTML, you can bypass the server-side rendering process for subsequent requests, leading to faster rendering.

10. Implement Progressive Rendering: Break down complex pages into smaller, incremental renderings. Prioritize rendering above-the-fold content first, while asynchronously loading and rendering additional content below the fold. This gives users a perception of faster loading and responsiveness.

## CSS Critical Render Path Optimization

Optimizing the CSS critical render path can significantly improve the rendering speed and performance of your web pages. Here are some CSS-related techniques to optimize the critical render path:

1. Minimize CSS Size: Reduce the size of your CSS files by removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and redundant code. Use CSS minification tools or preprocessors like Sass or Less to automatically strip out unnecessary characters and optimize your CSS.

2. Inline Critical CSS: Inline the critical CSS directly into the `<head>` section of your HTML document. By including the essential styles needed to render the above-the-fold content inline, you eliminate the need for additional HTTP requests and enable faster rendering of the initial visible content.

3. Load CSS Asynchronously: Load non-critical CSS files asynchronously using techniques like deferred loading or dynamically injecting the CSS using JavaScript. By loading CSS files asynchronously, you prevent them from blocking the rendering of the page and ensure faster rendering.

4. Prioritize Above-the-fold Styles: Identify the CSS rules that are essential for rendering the above-the-fold content and ensure they are loaded and applied before other styles. Use the `media` attribute to specify which stylesheets should be applied for different viewport sizes, prioritizing the critical stylesheets for the initial viewport.

5. Optimize CSS Selectors: Simplify and optimize your CSS selectors to improve rendering performance. Avoid using overly complex or inefficient selectors that require extensive browser computation. Prefer class and ID selectors over tag selectors when possible.

6. Reduce CSS Dependencies: Minimize the number of CSS dependencies and external stylesheets. Each additional CSS file adds an additional HTTP request, potentially slowing down rendering. Consolidate and combine CSS files to reduce the number of requests.

7. Use CSS Media Queries for Responsive Designs: Utilize CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the user's device capabilities and screen sizes. By serving appropriate styles for different viewports, you can optimize the rendering for specific devices, improving performance and user experience.

8. Use CSS Sprites for Images: Combine multiple small images into a single image sprite and use CSS background positioning to display specific images. By reducing the number of image requests, you improve rendering speed.

9. Avoid CSS Animations on Page Load: Minimize or defer CSS animations that trigger immediately on page load, as they can delay rendering and impact performance. Consider using JavaScript-based animations instead.

10. Leverage CSS Caching: Implement caching techniques to cache CSS files on the client's browser. This allows subsequent visits to your website to load cached CSS, reducing the need for fetching and parsing the CSS on every visit.

## Javascript Critical Render Path Optimization

Optimizing the JavaScript critical render path is crucial for improving the rendering speed and overall performance of your web pages. Here are some JavaScript-related techniques to optimize the critical render path:

1. Minimize JavaScript Size: Reduce the size of your JavaScript files by removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and redundant code. Utilize JavaScript minification tools or preprocessors like UglifyJS or Terser to automatically compress and optimize your JavaScript.

2. Inline Critical JavaScript: Inline the critical JavaScript code directly into the `<head>` section of your HTML document or immediately before the closing `</body>` tag. By including the essential JavaScript needed for rendering above-the-fold content inline, you eliminate the need for additional HTTP requests and enable faster rendering of the initial visible content.

3. Load JavaScript Asynchronously: Use the `async` or `defer` attributes when loading non-critical JavaScript files. These attributes allow the browser to load the JavaScript files without blocking the rendering of the page, ensuring faster rendering. Choose the appropriate attribute based on the dependency requirements of your JavaScript code.

4. Defer Execution of JavaScript: Move non-critical JavaScript code to the bottom of the page or use JavaScript techniques to defer its execution. By deferring the execution, you allow the browser to render the page content before processing the JavaScript, leading to faster rendering.

5. Use Progressive Enhancement: Apply progressive enhancement techniques by providing basic functionality and content to users even without JavaScript. This ensures that the page can be rendered and displayed quickly, regardless of JavaScript availability or execution speed.

6. Lazy Load JavaScript: Implement lazy loading techniques for JavaScript code that is not immediately required for the initial page load. Load and execute the JavaScript code only when it becomes necessary, such as when the user interacts with a specific element or triggers an event.

7. Code Splitting and Module Bundling: Split your JavaScript code into smaller modules and utilize a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup to bundle and optimize your code. Code splitting allows you to load only the required modules when needed, reducing the initial JavaScript payload and improving rendering speed.

8. Use JavaScript Caching: Implement browser caching mechanisms for JavaScript files to reduce the need for repeated fetching and parsing. Set appropriate caching headers or leverage techniques like cache busting to ensure efficient caching and reduce network requests.

9. Optimize JavaScript Performance: Write efficient and optimized JavaScript code to reduce execution time. Avoid unnecessary loops, minimize DOM manipulation, and optimize algorithms where possible. Use tools like Chrome DevTools' Performance panel or Lighthouse to identify performance bottlenecks in your JavaScript code.

10. Utilize Server-side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG): Implement server-side rendering or pre-rendering techniques to generate HTML content with JavaScript executed on the server. By serving pre-rendered HTML, you can improve the initial page load time and enable faster rendering.
